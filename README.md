# PHP Basic
## Getting started with PHP (XAMPP)
- To begin learning PHP you must already have a local server.
- XAMPP is a local server that is commonly andfrequently used by beginner PHP developers.
- So the first step to learning PHP is [installing XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), because __all PHP files and syntax can only be stored in the htdocs folder of XAMPP `C:\xampp\htdocs`.__
- Open `XAMPP control panel` then start `Apache` then open `localhost` on web browser.
- You can delete all htdocs default content if you want, open htdocs folder on VSCode, open terminal and then clone this repo to start learning PHP
```
git clone https://github.com/mkhotamirais/php-basic.git
```
- Then open on your browser
```
localhost/php-basic
```
